                            David the 1st's Description. Billy joined the kayak club as a PHD student four years ago. During that time he has gone from a slightly confused paddler to one of the best white water paddlers in the club. He has been to the Alps (French, Italian and Solvenian) three times already and paddled the white Nile in Uganda. He is also a former Captain, Safety Officer and President of the kayak club. The rest of this is just to test that justify actually wraps the text around the image that is there becasue I don't know that it actuallly will.
