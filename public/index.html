                            Pool sessions are held in the pool in Trinity College Sports Centre on Tuesday and Thursday from 8pm to 9pm during term. These sessions are for everyone and all you need are your normal swimming togs (swimsuit) and a swimming hat. It is very nice to learn the basics in a nice warm pool or if you are more advanced we can teach you to roll and maybe some flatwater playboating moves!

                            These trips happen most weekends rain or shine. As long as there are rescue available there is a trip. Every week these trips are catered towards the people that go. They are a really fun day out for very little. The only price is a small contribution towards the bus (no more than €10) or petrol for the people driving (usually about €5 but it varies slightly depending on trip length). We can go anywhere from the Boyne at Slane right the way to the Aughrim in Wicklow. Each week conditions will dictate what is possible. Some weeks we will be surfing awesome waves while others we will be running cool rivers.

                            White Water Kayaking is a type of kayaking where you get on a river at one point and get off some distance downstream. It is named after that frothy white water that you can see on the surface of turbulant water. The difficulty of the rivers are done in a I to VI Grading scale with Grade I being still water (swimming pool) and Grade VI being a place where some (most) people need clean shorts just looking at it. During the year we work up to Grade III which is fun but is also forgiving once there are some people around to help which is what the rescue are there for. The most important thing is that people have fun on the river!!

                            Also known as freestyle, or the older phrase rodeo, refers surfing river waves and holes, throwing down big moves, and generally performing aerial acrobatics in tiny boats. Playboating is both a great discipline in its own right, and also a fantastic way to develop the skills need to really push your whitewater progress. Popular spots for the club include features on the Liffey and Boyne, as well as Clifden, Tuam, and Oranmore in Galway. This is a varsities discipline and coaching is available within the club.

                            Sea kayaking is a new introduction to the club and refers to kayaking in longer boats around coastal waters. This is a great way to see the beautiful coastline of both Dublin Bay and further afield. These trips tend to be run in summer with destinations such as Dalkey Island, Ireland’s Eye, and Trips around Bray Head.

                            Surf kayaking refers to paddling in surf conditions in the sea and is a great way to learn to paddle. This involves catching waves in your boat, carving down them, and riding them into shore. This is a great discipline both for beginners learning to paddle and more advanced paddlers going big. Surf kayaking is an important part of both our Bundoran and Lahinch trips.
