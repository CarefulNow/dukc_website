# dukc_website
A website for Dublin University Kayak Club


## Running Locally
Download the full repo and cd into it. Then run npm install (you will need a working copy of npm and node already installed). npm start should then start a server running on http://localhost:8888 and you can view the website. If you make changes to a file and want to view them just save the file and reload the page. You don't need to bring the server down and restart to view changes.
